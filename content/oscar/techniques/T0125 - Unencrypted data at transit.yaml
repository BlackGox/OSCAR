summary: Unencrypted data in transit

description: |
  Data encryption in transit refers to the process of encrypting data as it moves between two points over a network or the internet. 
  In cloud security, this involves encrypting data as it travels between a user's device and the cloud server or between different cloud servers.
  Encryption in transit is important because data transmitted over networks can be intercepted and read by attackers. 
  Without encryption, sensitive data such as login credentials, financial information, or personal data can be easily accessed by attackers, putting the data and the users at risk.
