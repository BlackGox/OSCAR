summary: Add user

description: |
  Add user attack technique involves adding a new user account with privileged access to the system, allowing the attacker to continue to perform malicious activities even if their original access is removed or revoked.
  In this attack, the attacker gains access to the CI/CD system through various means, such as exploiting vulnerabilities or stealing credentials. 
  Once they have gained access, the attacker creates a new user account with elevated privileges, such as administrator or root access. 
  This allows the attacker to continue to access and control the system even if their original access is removed or blocked.
